AI Labels for consumer protection


In this medium, artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to support the creative process. This may apply to text, images, videos, music, or other media formats. AI support can be utilized in various stages of the creative process, such as ideation, creation, editing, or optimization of the content.

Depending on the proportion of AI-generated or AI-edited content, various labels are used for identification:

AI-A (Artificial Intelligence-Assisted): The term "AI-A" stands for "Artificial Intelligence-Assisted." With an AI-A label, the proportion of AI-generated or AI-edited content is between 25% and 49%. This label is intended to help users better understand the role of AI in the creative process and adjust their expectations of the medium accordingly.

AI-C (Artificial Intelligence-Collaborated): The term "AI-C" stands for "Artificial Intelligence-Collaborated." With an AI-C label, the proportion of AI-generated or AI-edited content is between 50% and 74%. This label signifies a significant collaboration between human and AI in creating the content and helps users understand the extent of AI involvement in the creative process.

AI-G (Artificial Intelligence-Generated): The term "AI-G" stands for "Artificial Intelligence-Generated." With an AI-G label, the proportion of AI-generated or AI-edited content is 75% or more. This label indicates that the majority of the content has been created by AI, with the human author playing a supportive or reviewing role.

AI-E (Artificial Intelligence-Edited): The term "AI-E" stands for "Artificial Intelligence-Edited." With an AI-E label, the content is primarily authored by a human but has been edited or corrected using AI assistance. This label is meant to help users understand that the content has been refined or improved with the help of AI technologies.

These labels are intended to help users better understand the role of AI in the creative process and adjust their expectations of the medium accordingly.

We are committed to promoting transparency regarding the use of AI in the creation and editing of content and raising awareness of the role and possibilities of AI in various media formats.
